# Santorini-Bot
## Goals
This project implements a fully playable version of the board game Santorini in Python, with different play modes. 
Currently, a two player mode and a Minimax search bot is implemented, with the goal of implementing Beam and Monte Carlo
search for further bots.

## Playing the Game
When running the code you will be firstly asked for the starting points of the workers. 
These inputs are validated and must be in the form of "2,1". Where the first number represents the row and the second
represents the column. Then you will be asked to select your play mode, either Co-Op or bot. Once this selection is made
you will be prompted to select a worker and decide if you want to move or build.   

You select the tile you want using the WASD keys, and you can move diagonally by combining directions e.g. Left/Up is WA.  

The game will end when a player has a worker on level 3.

## Santorini Walkthrough

A great guide is available at: https://en.boardgamearena.com/doc/Tips_santorini and a basic rundown of the game is below

#### Basics
* Currently, just 2 players  
* Each player has 2 workers  
  * Able to move and climb  
  * Able to move and build (Base, Mid, Top and Dome)  
  * Both can move to adjacent squares

* First worker up to three levels wins  
#### Characters
Provide unique buffs/skills:  
*	Prometheus: Worker can build if they do not move up (before and after moving)  
*	Hephaestus: Worker may build additional block (Not dome) on top of first block  
*	Demeter: Worker can build additional time but not on same space  
*	Hermes: If workers do not move up/down, they may move unlimited times (even zero)  
#### Setup
*	Workers can be placed on any empty space on the board  
*	Best to keep adjacent tiles free of workers for each player
#### Movement
*	Can move one space

*	Players can climb and descend buildings  
*	Incremental progression you can climb one level at a time  
*	First player up to third level wins  
*	Any player can build  
*	Player can add 4th level, the dome, which means it cannot be climbed anymore.
